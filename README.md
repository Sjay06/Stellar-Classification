This project focuses on classifying stars using parameters such as temperature, luminosity, radius, color, and apparent magnitude. We implemented and evaluated several machine learning models, including KNN Classifier, K-Means, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Adaboost, and Naive Bayes. The dataset, which includes these features along with the spectral class as the target variable, was split into training and testing sets. Each model's performance was assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Our comparative analysis provides insights into the efficacy of each model for stellar classification. The KNN Classifier and Random Forest models demonstrated high accuracy, while the SVM and Adaboost models showed strong precision and recall. We visualized the results through various plots, including accuracy comparisons, precision-recall-F1 score charts, and confusion matrices. These visualizations help highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each model, guiding the selection of the most appropriate algorithm for this classification task.

The repository includes detailed code and instructions in Jupyter notebooks, enabling easy replication and further exploration. By providing a comprehensive overview of the models and their performance, this project serves as a valuable resource for those interested in applying machine learning to astrophysical data and stellar classification.
